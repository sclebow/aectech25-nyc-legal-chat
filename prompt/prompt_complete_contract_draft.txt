My company is X, Y & Z Architects.
I want to develop a Owrner-Architect agreement contract draft for a project.
The project is named Snowdon Towers, located Bronsville PA.
I need help to prepare a draft of Owner-Architect agreement contract.
I want to be fair and minimize my legal risks.
Help me draft a contract for me.
